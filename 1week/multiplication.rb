Here are the rules:

Required: method needs to provide an object. Don’t just print to screen, it isn’t the goal.
The method needs to accept an Integer.
Required: the table object should have uniform spacing throughout the table.
Optional: You should be able to decorate the table with and without a heading and with and without decoration when asked for.
Preferred but optional: The heading may be Centered to the table, and the decoration (if the decoration is there). The decoration should hang one space (on each side) over the area taken by the numeric matrix. The heading should be on or within the same guide. (As shown in the 9x9 grid).
So, you may note that the method only takes one number. That is so there is no question about a YxY grid.

The goal here is having uniform columnar formatting, regardless of the result of the (valid) input. Everything else is ‘extra’ (and fun!).

Oh, only two samples were given, but, it should be able to handle decoration without heading, or heading without decoration, or both (as shown) or neither (as also shown). This part of it is the extra fun part.

Oh, a side note… You CAN copy and paste the sample solution for the 9x9 grid, and use that as test data, exactly as posted here (taking into account the “\n” that must exist as the last character of each line.

That is if you are using minitest (built into Ruby 1.9), or Test::Unit or Rspec or something other.
