# Here are the rules:
# 
# Required: method needs to provide an object. Don’t just print to screen, it isn’t the goal.
# The method needs to accept an Integer.
# Required: the table object should have uniform spacing throughout the table.
# Optional: You should be able to decorate the table with and without a heading and with and without decoration when asked for.
# Preferred but optional: The heading may be Centered to the table, and the decoration (if the decoration is there). The decoration should hang one space (on each side) over the area taken by the numeric matrix. The heading should be on or within the same guide. (As shown in the 9x9 grid).
# So, you may note that the method only takes one number. That is so there is no question about a YxY grid.
